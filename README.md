# Data Exploration and Analyitics 
I used the top2018 spotify public data 
the data uses various features like loudness, instrumental, liveliness, etc to determine highest levels of popularity in songs on spotify
I explore various statistical concepts 
I review other subjects such as:
R Squared and Adjusted R squared
Visualization
Mean Squared Error and Other Forms of Error
Mean Absolute Percentage Error, and Mean Percentage Error
Akaike and Bayesian Information Criteria
